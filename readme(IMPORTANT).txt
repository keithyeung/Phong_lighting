/*This is an University Assignment that I tried to implement Phong-lighting model. Most of the code for setting up OpenGL was NOT created and implemented by me. Our lecturer basically created a little engine for us to learn OpenGL. He go through the process of setting up OpenGL with us but it was very hard to follow because It's the first time I get to learn anything for graphics programming.

I've only worked on 
application.hpp/ application.cpp 
world.fs.glsl/world.vs.glsl

Therefore I will only upload these files. */

This project is an attempt to create the phong light model in OpenGL. I've created some input for putting the directional light into different direction. It's a very simple attempt with just creating a wall and three cubes and testing out the GLSL code, and eventually it worked.
