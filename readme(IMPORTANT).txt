This is an University Assignment that I tried to implement Phong-lighting model. Most of the code for setting up OpenGL was NOT created and implemented by me. Our lecturer basically created a little engine for us to learn OpenGL. He go through the process of setting up OpenGL with us but it was very hard to follow because It's the first time I get to learn anything for graphics programming.

I've only worked on 
application.hpp/ application.cpp 
world.fs.glsl/world.vs.glsl

Therefore I will only upload these files.
